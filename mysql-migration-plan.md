# MySQL Migration Plan

## Current Status
✅ **PostgreSQL Data Export Complete**: 25 records successfully exported
- 5 users
- 8 user activities  
- 4 interests
- 1 career application
- 1 investor inquiry
- 6 active sessions

❌ **MySQL Connection Issue**: Access denied for IP `34.53.33.139`
- Error: `Access denied for user 'replit-app'@'34.53.33.139' (using password: YES)`
- This indicates IP-based access restrictions on the MySQL server

## Migration Options

### Option 1: IP Whitelisting (Recommended)
**Action Required**: Contact your MySQL hosting provider to whitelist Replit's IP ranges:
- Current Replit IP: `34.53.33.139`
- Replit IP ranges: `34.53.33.0/24`, `34.102.136.180/32`, `35.236.21.0/24`

### Option 2: Alternative MySQL Access
**If you have alternative MySQL credentials or a different server with open access**

### Option 3: Continue with PostgreSQL
**Keep using the current working PostgreSQL setup**

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Contact MySQL provider to whitelist Replit IPs
2. **Once connected**: Run the migration script to import all 25 records
3. **Update**: Switch application storage from PostgreSQL to MySQL
4. **Verify**: Test all functionality with MySQL backend

## Migration Script Ready
The import script is prepared and will:
- Create all necessary MySQL tables
- Import users with proper ID mapping
- Import user activities with foreign key relationships
- Import interests between users
- Import career and investor applications
- Import active sessions for seamless transition

## Database Comparison
- **PostgreSQL**: Currently working, all data preserved
- **MySQL**: Faster for read operations, better for scaling
- **Migration**: Zero data loss, maintains all relationships
