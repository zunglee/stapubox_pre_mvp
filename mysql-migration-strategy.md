# MySQL Migration Strategy

## Current Situation
✅ **MySQL Connection**: Working via terminal (`mysql -h 147.93.107.184 -u replit-app -p`)  
❌ **Node.js Connection**: Access denied (IP restrictions for programmatic access)  
❌ **CREATE Permissions**: User only has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions

## User Permissions
```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `stapubox_replit`.* TO `replit-app`@`%`
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `replit_v1`.* TO `replit-app`@`%`
```

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Request Admin Access (Recommended)
Contact your MySQL admin to:
1. Create the required tables using the schema in `migrate-to-mysql.sql`
2. Grant CREATE permissions to `replit-app` user
3. Allow programmatic access from Replit IPs

### Option 2: Manual Table Creation
If you have admin access, run the table creation script manually:
```sql
-- Run this with admin privileges
SOURCE migrate-to-mysql.sql;
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Tables
If tables already exist with different names, we can adapt the import script.

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
1. Keep PostgreSQL for development
2. Use MySQL for production after proper setup
3. Implement dual storage support

## Ready for Migration
Once tables are created, the import is ready:
- 25 records ready for import
- Data mapping script prepared
- Verification queries included

## Next Steps
1. Get table creation permissions OR
2. Have admin create tables OR  
3. Continue with PostgreSQL (current working solution)

## File Status
- `postgresql-export.json`: Complete data export (25 records)
- `import-to-mysql.js`: Ready for import once connection works
- `migrate-to-mysql.sql`: Table creation schema ready
